The Wavefunction device
=======================

The ``forest.wavefunction`` device provides an interface between PennyLane and
the Forest SDK `wavefunction simulator <https://pyquil-docs.rigetti.com/en/stable/wavefunction_simulator.html>`_. Because
the wavefunction simulator allows access and manipulation of the underlying quantum state vector,
``forest.wavefunction`` is able to support the full suite of PennyLane and Quil quantum operations and observables.

In addition, it is generally faster than running equivalent simulations on the QVM, as the final state
can be inspected and the expectation value calculated analytically, rather than by sampling measurements.

.. note::

    By default, ``forest.wavefunction`` is initialized with ``shots=0``, indicating
    that the exact analytic expectation value is to be returned.

    If the number of trials or shots provided to the ``forest.wavefunction`` is
    instead non-zero, a spectral decomposition is performed and a Bernoulli distribution
    is constructed and sampled. This allows the ``forest.wavefunction`` device to
    'approximate' the effect of sampling the expectation value.

Usage
~~~~~

You can instantiate the device in PennyLane as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pennylane as qml

    dev_wfun = qml.device('forest.wavefunction', wires=2)
    
This device can then be used just like other devices for the definition and evaluation of QNodes within PennyLane.

A simple quantum function that returns the expectation value and variance of a measurement and 
depends on three classical input parameters would look like:

.. code-block:: python

    @qml.qnode(dev_wfun)
    def circuit(x, y, z):
        qml.RZ(z, wires=[0])
        qml.RY(y, wires=[0])
        qml.RX(x, wires=[0])
        qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
        return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), var(qml.PauliZ(1))

You can then execute the circuit like any other function to get the quantum mechanical expectation value and variance:

>>> circuit(0.2, 0.1, 0.3)
array([0.97517033, 0.04904283])

Device options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On initialization, the PennyLane-Forest devices accept additional keyword
arguments beyond the PennyLane default device arguments.

``forest_url`` (*str*)
    the Forest URL server. Can also be set by
    the environment variable ``FOREST_SERVER_URL``, or in the ``~/.qcs_config``
    configuration file. Default value is ``"https://forest-server.qcs.rigetti.com"``.

``qvm_url`` (*str*)
    the QVM server URL. Can also be set by the environment
    variable ``QVM_URL``, or in the ``~/.forest_config`` configuration file.
    Default value is ``"http://127.0.0.1:5000"``.

``compiler_url`` (*str*)
    the compiler server URL. Can also be set by the environment
    variable ``COMPILER_URL``, or in the ``~/.forest_config`` configuration file.
    Default value is ``"http://127.0.0.1:6000"``.

.. note::

    If using the downloadable Forest SDK with the default server configurations
    for the QVM and the Quil compiler (i.e., you launch them with the commands
    ``qvm -S`` and ``quilc -R``), then you will not need to set these keyword arguments.

    Likewise, if you are running PennyLane using the Rigetti Quantum Cloud Service (QCS)
    on a provided QMI, these environment variables are set automatically and will also
    not need to be passed in PennyLane.

Supported operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All devices support all PennyLane `operations and observables <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/operations.html#qubit-operations>`_, with
he exception of the PennyLane ``QubitStateVector`` state preparation operation.

In addition, PennyLane-Forest provides the following PyQuil-specific operations for PennyLane.
These are all importable from :mod:`pennylane_forest.ops <.ops>`.

These operations include:

.. autosummary::
    pennylane_forest.ops.CPHASE
    pennylane_forest.ops.ISWAP
    pennylane_forest.ops.PSWAP
